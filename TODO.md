- `AppKind` can be deprecated?
- A better way to close the definitions?
- Unordered oblivious case (only need to change parser)
- Scrap my boilerplate: instances for Monad, Eq1, etc
- Support tuple pattern in product case and oblivious sum case
- Consider checking labels in type equivalence
- Consider adding tests
- Add program context for better inference
- Error messages for `isProd` / `isOProd` / `isPi` could be confusing in
  introduction form
- Error message for dependent expressions are confusing and redundant
